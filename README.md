If you would like to run this code on your own bot please follow these instructions:
1. Go to discord.com/developers and login
2. In the top right hand corner click New Application and give it a name
3. You can now customize the bot how you would like with a banner, pfp, description, etc.
4. Go to the bot tab on the left hand side and make sure that all 3 Privileged Gateway Intents are turned on
5. Scroll back up and click the reset token button (you may need to input your 2fa code) and click the copy button
6. Come back to this and make a file called discordToken.py
7. In that file create a var called token and set it equal to the token you just copied (look below)
    token = "YOUR TOKEN HERE"

8. If you have any issues please feel free to contact @realgrk on Discord
